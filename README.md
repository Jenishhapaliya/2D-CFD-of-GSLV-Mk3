# 2D-CFD-of-GSLV-Mk3
Here, I am performed the 2 dimesional velocity, temperature and pressure study of GSLV MK-3 rocket. I applied different boundary conditions to observe the phenomena. I used snappyHexMesh- mesh type in element to generate mesh. I get some fanstastic results and my heart is blowing.
